NAME
  objectpool.rb

DESCRIPTION
  a simple, robust, generic thread-safe object pool for ruby

SYNOPSIS

  1) pre-configured with objects

    connections = [connect, connect, connect, connect]
    pool = ObjectPool.new 

    Thread.new do
      pool.get do |connection|
        connection.send data
      end
    end

  2) dynamically building objects as needed

    pool = ObjectPool.new(:size => 4){ connect }

    Thread.new do
      pool.get do |connection|
        connection.send data
      end
    end
